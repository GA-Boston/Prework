# WDI Prework
Dear WDI Student,

The goal of this prework is to provide exposure to crucial concepts in web-based programming that we'll be returning to and covering in-depth during the course.  It should take approximately 60 hours to complete, so plan ahead and give yourself ample time.

**IMPORTANT: Completion of this prework is mandatory.**

As mentioned in your welcome email, you will have two check-in calls: the first just to see how youâ€™re progressing, and the second to test your skills with a code-based quiz.

Please reach out to your course producer if you have any questions about anything or need help.  **Happy coding** and get ready to be immersed for 12 straight weeks!
