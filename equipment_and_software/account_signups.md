# Account Signups

Sign up for the following accounts that you'll be using for the prework and during class:

- [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) - Watch for your invitation, and be sure to sign up with your real name!
- [Github](http://www.github.com)
- [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)

Be sure to keep your usernames and passwords in a safe but accessible place so you can get to them once the course begins; one great cross-platform tool for handling this is [KeyPassX](http://www.keepassx.org/) a 'password safe' that stores your usernames and passwords in an encrypted file.
