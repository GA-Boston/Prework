# Account Signups

Sign up for the following accounts that you'll be using for the prework and during class:

- [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) - Watch for your invitation, and be sure to sign up with your real name!
- [Github](http://www.github.com)
- [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)

Be sure to keep your usernames and passwords in a safe but accessible place so you can get to them once the course begins; one great tool for this is [KeyPassX](http://www.keepassx.org/), which allows you to encrypt all of your passwords using a single master key.
