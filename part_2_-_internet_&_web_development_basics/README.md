# PART 2 - Internet & Web Development Basics

Believe it or not, the web and the internet are two distinct things; the internet is a giant web of networked computers sending messages back and forth, while the web is an *application* - in essence, a service - which runs over the internet and delivers web pages. 

In the first set of readings, you'll explore the foundations of the web, and dig into networking and server-client relationships - in other words, how computers talk to each other and share information.

In the second set, you'll dive into web pages themselves with a look at two of their fundamental building blocks, HTML and CSS. These two languages are usually referred to as 'front-end' languages because they control much of the look and feel of webpages, and because the HTML and CSS files themselves are actually delivered to the user's browser (a.k.a. the client) and can be found on the user's computer.
