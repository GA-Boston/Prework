# PART 3 - Programming Basics & Version Control

There's no magic amount of time it takes one to be an expert at programming.  10 years, 10,000 hours, it's all irrelevant.  Everyone moves at their own pace and finds different elements more intriguing than others.

The first, and arguably the most improtant, part of the course focuses on becoming a programmer and learning how to think like a developer.  This is a selection of resources to expose you to some of the major concepts of Ruby and Git.  Keep in mind this is a surface-level exploration: class will go much deeper and provide a world of context around what you're typing.

Think about learning a programming language like learning a foreign language: there's a slurry of words to memorize and a grammar to adopt; it starts out cumbersomem, awkward, and seemingly repetitive, and with time becomes fluid, second nature, and full of finesse.
