# PART 3 - Programming Basics & Version Control

Welcome to the 'meat and potatoes' of the pre-work, where for the first time, we'll start to look at the core work of being a developer - programming!

First, we'll dive into Ruby, the language we use to help teach you the fundamentals of programming, and the focus of the first few weeks of WDI. Why Ruby? First, Ruby is the language that the popular web framework Rails is written in, so learning Ruby is a prerequisite to learning Rails. Second, not only is Ruby similar to many other *object-oriented* languages that you'll come across, it also happens to be pretty flexible, well-documented, and easy to read - in other words, it's very beginner-friendly.

Then, we'll explore a tool called Git, which allows us to track and store changes in our code, and even share them with the world. This is an **extremely** useful thing when you're working on large projects with lots of files, where it's easy to forget exactly what you've done.

These resources will expose you to a lot of the major concepts of Ruby and Git. However, keep in mind that *this is only a preliminary exploration* - these topics will be covered more deeply, and with greater context, during class, so don't worry about acheiving mastery here just yet. 

That said, having a good grasp of these concepts will make things much easier for you later on, so do your best to get really solid on the basics now. And don't be afraid to ask for help! It's much better to clear up misconceptions now, rather than several weeks into the course.
