# Git (10 hours)

Git is software that helps developers with keeping track of changes to files as we build our web apps. It's called version control, and it's basically a backed-up history of everything that's happened to your code. Git is also a powerful tool to share code and work with others collaboratively, through services like [GitHub](http://github.com).

###Resources:

- [What is Version Control?](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) - Learn what version control is from the makers of Git
- [Understand the Git Flow](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/) - Get an overview of a Git workflow
- [Try Git](http://try.github.io/) - A great way to try working with git from your browser

###Assess Yourself:

- Explain to a friend what Git and Github are, and why you would use version control in software development.
- Make a local repository; then, make edits to your code, and commit the changes.
- Create a remote repository for a project on Github.
