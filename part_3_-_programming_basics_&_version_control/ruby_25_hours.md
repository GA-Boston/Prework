# Ruby (25 hours)

Now we'll dig deeper into programming with a full-featured language: Ruby! It's very friendly to beginners and has all sorts of "syntactical sugar" -- little shortcuts that get more done with less code. We'll be using tons of Ruby throughout the course: it's a popular choice as a back-end language and a fundamental building block for a web application.  Fun fact: Ruby can also be used to write non-web programs.

###Resources:

- [Code School - Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) - A short, fun interactive tutorial online.
- [Code School - Ruby Bits](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby-bits) - Go through levels 1-3
- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/) - Exercises 1-14, 18-44 -- Donâ€™t install Ruby, use [REPL.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby)
- [Chris Pine's Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) - A really good tutorial about programming concepts, taught in Ruby. We recommend working through chapters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as well as section 3 of chapter 11. The ebook is available online for free, or can be downloaded as a PDF for $18.
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) - Bookmark this! No need to give it more than a quick skim for now, but this reference will help you make sure that you're using good syntax and proper conventions (which will help make your code easier to read).

###Assess Yourself:

Instead of attempting to install Ruby (and creating headaches at Installfest), test your chops with an online console at [REPL.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby) -- a tool for programming in Ruby online.

- Print out all the numbers from 1 to 100
- Write a method called *greet* that takes a person's name as an argument and **RETURNS* (not prints) "Hello" plus that person's name (i.e. `hello("You") ==> "Hello You!"`).
- Write a method, `double`, that takes a number `num` as an argument and **returns** 2 times that number.
- Write a method, `is_even?`, that takes a number num as an argument and **returns** `true` if it is even and `false` otherwise.
- Write a "fizzbuzz" method that takes in an argument(x) and prints out all the numbers from 1 to X. HOWEVER, there are some exceptions. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, the method should print out "fizz" instead of the number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, the method should print out "buzz". And, if the number is evenly divisible by both 3 AND 5, the method should print out "fizzbuzz". For example, calling `fizzbuzz(16)` should print out

	```ruby
		1
		2
		fizz
		4
		buzz
		fizz
		7
		8
		fizz
		buzz
		11
		fizz
		13
		14
		fizzbuzz
	```
- Create an array with five different names in it: "Tom", "Alex", "Denise", "Phillip", and "Claire". Then, modify the array to replace "Phillip" with "Michael".
- Create a hash with the following key/value pairs:
	"Tom" / "Jerry"
	"Peanut Butter" / "Jelly"
	"Lucy" / "Ethel"
	"Batman" / "Robin"
	"Asterix" / "Obelix"
- Define a Ruby class called 'Dog', with a method called 'bark' that returns the string "WOOF"; then, create an new instance of 'Dog' and call its 'bark' method.

**Be sure to test your code!**

###Go Deeper:

- [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) - This tutorial is a good review once you're familiar with the concepts.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/) have large sets of challenge problems - see how many of these you can do!
