# Ruby (30 hours)

Now we'll dig deeper into programming with a full-featured language: Ruby! It's very friendly to beginners and has all sorts of "syntactical sugar" -- little shortcuts that get more done with less code. We'll be using tons of Ruby throughout the course: it's a popular choice as a back-end language and a fundamental building block for a web application.  Fun fact: Ruby can also be used to write non-web programs.

###Resources:

- [Code School - Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) - A short, fun interactive tutorial online.
- [Code School - Ruby Bits](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits) - Go through levels 1-3
- [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) - Work through the whole thing.
- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/) - Exercises 1-14, 18-44 -- Donâ€™t install Ruby, use [REPL.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby)
- [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/) - RubyMonk is an *excellent* set of tutorials on Ruby, ranging from beginner level to advanced. For now, work only through the following units; if you want to come back after you finish the pre-work and try the others, go right ahead!
	- Introduction To Ruby Objects
	- Introduction to Strings
	- Conditions and Loops: Control Structures in Ruby
	- Arrays in Ruby
	- Hashes in Ruby
- [Chris Pine's Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) - A really good tutorial about programming concepts, taught in Ruby. We recommend working through chapters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as well as section 3 of chapter 11. The ebook is available online for free, or can be downloaded as a PDF for $18.
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) - Bookmark this! No need to give it more than a quick skim for now, but this reference will help you make sure that you're using good syntax and proper conventions (which will help make your code easier to read).

###Assess Yourself:

Instead of attempting to install Ruby on your computer (and creating headaches at Installfest), test your chops with [REPL.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby) an online console and text editor for programming in Ruby.

- Print out all the numbers from 1 to 100
- Write a method called `greet` that takes a person's name as an argument and **returns** (not prints) "Hello" plus that person's name (i.e. `hello("You") ==> "Hello You!"`).
- Write a method called `double` that takes a number `num` as an argument and **returns** two times the value of `num`.
- Write a method called `is_even?` that takes a number `num` as an argument and **returns** `true` if it is even and `false` otherwise.
- Write a method called `fizzbuzz` that takes in an argument(x) and prints out all the numbers from 1 to X. HOWEVER, there are some exceptions. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, the method should print out "fizz" instead of the number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, the method should print out "buzz". And, if the number is evenly divisible by both 3 AND 5, the method should print out "fizzbuzz". For example, calling `fizzbuzz(16)` should print out

	```ruby
		1
		2
		fizz
		4
		buzz
		fizz
		7
		8
		fizz
		buzz
		11
		fizz
		13
		14
		fizzbuzz
	```
- Create an array with five different names in it: "Tom", "Alex", "Denise", "Phillip", and "Claire". Then, modify the array to replace "Phillip" with "Michael".
- Create a hash with all of the following key/value pairs:
	- "Tom" / "Jerry"
	- "Peanut Butter" / "Jelly"
	- "Lucy" / "Ethel"
	- "Batman" / "Robin"
	- "Asterix" / "Obelix"

- Define a Ruby class called 'Dog', with a method called `bark` that returns the string "WOOF"; then, create an new instance of 'Dog' and call its `bark` method.

**Be sure to test your code!**

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/) have large sets of challenge problems - see how many of these you can do!
